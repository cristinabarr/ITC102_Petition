Online Petition


I signed the Change.org petition "End Greyhound Racing Nationwide", this particular petition being aimed at the Governor of Alabama. <br>
In my home stat of Florida, greyhound race tracks have long been a mainstay in multiple locations around the state for sports betting, and in my <br>
view has lasted way too long. ince 2008, nearly 1,000 racing greyhounds have died and 12,000 have suffered injuries -- including broken legs, crushed skulls, broken necks, paralysis, seizures, and death by electrocution. And these are just the reported injuries and deaths. The vast majority of the 80,000 greyhounds born into dog racing can't even be accounted for.<br>
It is still legal in six states and it is time to end this abusive practice.
